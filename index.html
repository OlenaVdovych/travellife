                        was
                        about 4,800 feet and marked by a milestone, giving birth to the saying “All roads lead to Rome.”
                        4. In Ancient Rome, only free-born men were allowed to wear togas, a sign of Roman citizenship.

                        the walls of the Colosseum, and sleeping among the ruins of the Forum.
                        8. Women in ancient Rome dyed their hair with goat fat and beech wood ashes. The most popular
                        colors

                        little

                        Get ready to make Paris your own.
                        There’s a reason Paris is one of the most popular cities among travelers.
                        Known as the “City of Light” or the “City of Love,” the streets of Paris overflow with culture,
                        art,
                        beauty,
                        and
                        history.
                        Whether searching out Monet’s Water Lilies at Musée de l’Orangerie, climbing the many steps of
                        Sacré-Cœur,
                        standing before the Eiffel Tower in awe, or searching out the best crepes along the Seine, Paris
                        is
                        a city
                        that
                        captures the hearts of millions ever year.
                        Believe it or not though, Paris wasn’t always called “Paris,” and the Eiffel Tower wasn’t
                        supposed
                        to be a
                        permanent fixture. Here are 10 interesting facts about Paris:
                        1. The Eiffel Tower was supposed to be a temporary installation, intended to stand for 20 years
                        after being
                        built for the 1889 World Fair.
                        2. Paris was originally a Roman City called “Lutetia.”
                        3. It’s believed that Paris only has one stop sign in the entire city.
                        4. A flat in Paris was left unoccupied under lock and key for 70 years, but the rent was paid
                        every
                        month;

                    <p class="sectextdsc">Atmospheric backstreets paint a very different picture to first impressions of
                        Abu
                        Dhabi.
                        The often slick and modern capital of the U.A.E. presents a fascinating mixture of tradition and
                        progression.
                        Tracing its rich history back to around 3000 B.C., Abu Dhabi maintains a more distinctly Arabian
                        ambiance
                        than glitzy Dubai.
                        Taxis are a safe, reliable way to get around sites such as The Corniche Park, the White Fort,
                        the
                        Heritage

                        soon as possible, for example, Abu Dhabi is the largest emirate in terms of the total area. It

                        over 6
                        times the area combined of all the other emirates. Abu Dhabi is not only the capital of the
                        United
                        Arab
                        Emirates but also the most populous city of the country.
                        The emirate has the world’s largest concentrated solar power station at the Shams solar power
                        station.

                        brand park across the globe.
                        Abu Dhabi streets are known to be the first streets for the world’s best cars to hit, much
                        before
                        they can
                        be seen anywhere in the world.
                        By 2030, Abu Dhabi will have an impeccable and unbeatable public transport with specially built
                        heavy and
                        light rail roads.
                        The Capital Gate tower of Abu Dhabi is the world’s furthest leaning tower with 18 degrees lean.

                        tons, the
                        chandelier is one of a kind in the world.
                        The estimated population by the end of 2030 is supposed to be somewhere quadruple of 1.6 million
                        (the
                        present population approximately) and the city is gearing up for it.</p>
